# Clustering
This chapter will get you introduced to the fundamentals of Clustering which will be illustrated with two unsupervised learning algorithms. You will be implementing flat clustering with the k-means algorithm and hierarchical clustering with the mean shift algorithm. By the end of this chapter you will have a firm grasp on the basics of Clustering.
